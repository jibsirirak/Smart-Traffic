Smart Traffic is created to facilitate the police in changing traffic lights. Which can control traffic lights through an application.


## Technologies Used
software
- Arduino IDE
- snack.expo.io 
- C++
- React-native

hardware
- Board esp32 Lite
- Buzzer
- LED
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Seven segment 4 digit
- Breadboard
- สาย Jumper 

## Features
- There are 2 modes to control through the application.
  1) manual mode is that we will be able to press the number of the light pole to change the lights immediately.
  2) auto mode is to let the light pole count the time and change it manually according to the specified time.
- The application will change in real time
- There will be an ultrasonic sensor to check if there is a vehicle overcoming the traffic or trying to cut a red light or not.
If there is, remember to sound the alarm through the buzzer.
